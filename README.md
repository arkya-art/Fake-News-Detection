# Fake-News-Detection
In this we propose machine learning techniques, in particular supervised learning, for fake news detection. More precisely, we used a dataset of fake and real news to train a machine learning model using Scikit-learn library in Python. We extracted features from the dataset using text representation models like Bag-of-Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bi-gram frequency. We tested two classification approaches, namely probabilistic classification and linear classification on the title and the content, checking if it is clickbait/nonclickbait, respectively fake/real.
